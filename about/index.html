        <h2 class="w3-text-grey">The Task</h2>
        <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
        <p> Build a prototype that shows a potentially very long list of messages.
            Users should be able to swipe a message horizontally offscreen to dismiss it.
            Messages should load automatically so that a user scrolling slowly should never see the bottom of the list.
            The prototype should work well even after many messages have been loaded.
        </p>

        <h2 class="w3-text-grey">Implementation</h2>
        <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
        <p> Given a mockup, I started with implementing a prototype that follows it. When the initial prototype was done, I tested the interaction and added features more features to it to enhance to user experience.
            For the prototype implementation I chose to use <a href=https://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a>, with the Google Material UI guidelines, implemented with the <a href=http://www.material-ui.com/">react-material-ui</a> framework. I used <a href="https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable">react-swipeable</a> to handle the messages swiping events.
        </p>

        <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-grey">Infinite Scroll</h3>
        <div class="w3-row-padding">
        <div class="w3-half">
            <img src="/infinite-message-scroll/about/imgs/scroll_to_top.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width:400px;">
        </div>
        <div class="w3-half">
        <p>The App loads twenty messages in each API request. As the user scrolls through the messages, when she reaches a specific height, more messages are loaded through the API. This give an infinite scroll experience.
            Since scrolling can become very long, and the user might not be interested in scrolling back through all the messages she already saw, I added a "scroll to top" button.  The button only appears after scrolling down, and clicking it shows an animation as the app automatically scrolls to the top of the messages list.

            <div>
                <p> As a message is swiped to the right, it becomes transparent, signaling to the user that it is going to be deleted. When the swipe is done, the message is animated out of the screen and disappears.
                    A toast appears at the bottom, telling the user that the message was deleted and allowing her to undo the deletion.

                    Infinite scrolling can make it hard for the user to find items she liked. I decided to add a bookmarking option. Using the swipe left gesture, the user can star and un-star messages.
                </p>
                <p>Clicking on the star icon at the header bar filters the messages. It toggles a presentation of all messages or only the messages that were starred.
                    Being able to easily filter a long list of items is important and can save time and effort for the user.
